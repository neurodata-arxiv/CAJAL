###########################################################################

### 2015-07-13 ### v1.8.0 RC2
Release Notes:
 - Updated all queries to reflect change in OCP schema. All projects now have an associated token and associated channels. To get data, a token and channel must be specified.
 - Updated all query checks to use new isotropic database format. This essentially means we treat X, Y, and Z the same way when checking bounds. 
 - Added a README to the test directory to guide users through running unit tests.
 - Added a single unit test driver (testOCPsingle.m)

Bug Fixes:
 - getFields and setFields queries fixed.
 - ramonVol Offset Indexing bug fixed.
 - Read channel type from HDF5 files 
 - UploadImageData test fixed and passes against all servers.

Known Issues:
 - multichannel cutouts are currently not supported. To perform a multichannel cutout, run the same query multiple times, changing the image or anno channel between each run. Supporting multichannel cutouts would require more major changes to CAJAL. 
 - RGBa data support has changed in the new OCP. CAJAL RGBa functions have been disabled.  
 - The imageSlice and imageDense Download tests fail because the kasthuri11 z-indices on current dev servers don't seem to match the previous z-indices. It seems like the z-offset should be 1 instead of 0. Waiting on data migration in main OCP datastore to confirm. 

Compatibility:
 - Open Connectome Schema v0.7, Open Connectome Server v0.7

Updates:

Bug Fixes:

Known Issues:
 - channel names with hyphens break hdf5 parsing and are temporarily patched.
 - RAMONNonNeuron and RAMONAttributedRegion not yet supported in API or
   server side.
 - Converting a RAMONVolume (and subclasses) voxel data to a bounding box
   is not yet supported.
 - Matlab wrapper only supported by Linux/OSX.  This is OK for now since it is 
   intended for use with the LONI Pipeline server which should be running on CentOS/RHEL


### 2014-12-20 ### v1.6

Release Notes: 
 - Updated OCP.m and OCPHdf.m to meet new OCP service interfaces

Updates:

Bug Fixes:

Known Issues:
 - channel names with hyphens break hdf5 parsing and are temporarily patched.
 - block ID reservation service still drops 1 ID on the floor after each call.
   This causes the unit test to currently fail, but is still usable.

   server side.
 - Converting a RAMONVolume (and subclasses) voxel data to a bounding box
   is not yet supported.
 - Local database resource only available to Linux and OSX users currently
 - Matlab wrapper only supported by Linux/OSX.  This is OK for now since it is 
   intended for use with the LONI Pipeline server which should be running on CentOS/RHEL


### 2014-12-06 ### v1.5

Release Notes: 

Updates:
 - Main updates to I2G software (to be migrated to separate repo)

Bug Fixes:
 - Minor bug fixes

Known Issues:
 - channel names with hyphens break hdf5 parsing and are temporarily patched.
 - block ID reservation service still drops 1 ID on the floor after each call.
   This causes the unit test to currently fail, but is still usable.
 - RAMONNonNeuron and RAMONAttributedRegion not yet supported in API or
   server side.
 - Converting a RAMONVolume (and subclasses) voxel data to a bounding box
   is not yet supported.
 - Local database resource only available to Linux and OSX users currently

   intended for use with the LONI Pipeline server which should be running on CentOS/RHEL


### 2014-10-13 ### v1.4

Release Notes: 

Updates:
 - Added MatlabMonitor class.  This is used to monitor status from inside 
   applications running in LONI Pipeline
 - Added OCP.getPublicTokens(). Returns cell array of public tokens for the
   current server.
 - Added multichannel data support
    - OCP.getChannelList returns cell array of channels in the current image
      database, based on the image token
    - OCPQuery.setChannels lets you set the channels to query. Use 
      OCPQueryType.imageDense and set channels as a cell array
    - OCP.query will return a cell array of RAMONVolume objects.  The name
      field will be set to the channel name, and be in the same order as
      the channels listed in the query.
    - The viewer will support displaying a single 16-bit channel as an 
      individual grayscale image by calling image() on the RAMONVolume
    - NOTE: currently there is a temporary patch due to the names of certain
      channels.  If the channel name includes a hyphen, when the API queries
      the db for channel names it will replace hyphens with two underscores.
      You will notice this in getPublicTokens. If the API detects a channel
      name with two underscores in it, it will automatically replace with a 
      hyphen when quering for data.  This is a temporary patch due to a
      MATLAB issue that will be fixed in the future.

Bug Fixes:
 - Added temporary fix to require a default resolution when merging annotations
 - Fixed bug in cubeCutout* that caused 'remainder' blocks to skip 1 pixel
 - Fixed x/y bounds flip in block upload url.  Only effected edges of datasets

Known Issues:
 - channel names with hyphens break hdf5 parsing and are temporarily patched.
 - block ID reservation service still drops 1 ID on the floor after each call.
   This causes the unit test to currently fail, but is still usable.
 - RAMONNonNeuron and RAMONAttributedRegion not yet supported in API or
   server side.
 - Converting a RAMONVolume (and subclasses) voxel data to a bounding box
   is not yet supported.
 - Local database resource only available to Linux and OSX users currently
 - Matlab wrapper only supported by Linux/OSX.  This is OK for now since it is 
   intended for use with the LONI Pipeline server which should be running on CentOS/RHEL

### 2014-08-25 ### v1.3

Release Notes: 
 - The enumeration eRAMONUploadDataType has been depricated and should no longer
   be used.  It has been replaced by eRAMONDataType
 - When downloading data, the dataType property of the RAMON object will indicate
   the type of data stored.  This is always based off the token used to download
   the data.  When uploading, if the datatype is not specified, the project info
   based on the appropriate annotation/image token will be used.

Updates:
 - Added block ID reservation service.  Useful for writing data in chunks and
   pre-allocating IDs.
 - Added RGBA32 data format support
 - Updated built-in viewer to support RGBA32 data
 - Changed eRAMONUploadDataType to eRAMONDataType to support new and future
   features

 - Updated SemaphoreTool to use server-side configuration, cleaned up resets,
   and added some new helper methods
 - Updated OCP and OCPNetwork to optionally use distributed semaphore 
   configuration from the redis server.  All that is required is the server
   hostname and port be saved in /api/matlab/ocp/semaphore_settings.mat.
   /api/matlab/ocp/semaphore_settings_example.mat is provided as a starting 
   point for new installs. OCP('semaphore') will trigger config and enable 
   the distributed semaphore.
 - Added Cube Cutout Preprocess Cuboid Aligned which computes subcubes that
   respect database cuboid boundaries for efficiency. Also adds ability to 
   compute "merge" region blocks which are 2 voxel blocks around each

   an OCPQuery object that will download a matching image or annotation volume
   respectively
 - Increased java interface library read timeout to 10min to support very 
   large writes at load
 - Added ability to save RAMONVolume objects as HDF5 files to OCPHdf
 - Changed default OCP server location to braingraphdev1.cs.jhu.edu for
   APL integration purposes(should be openconnecto.me in released software)

 - Added get/set field interface to existing annotations.  You can now get 
   most fields and set single value field without downloading the annotation
   or posting a new annotation.
 - Added idListLimit property to OCPQuery.  This can be used in conjunction 
   with RAMON Id List Queries to limit the number of objects returned.  This 
   is useful in large databases when you only want a few things back.
